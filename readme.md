All blog posts display a *More articles &rarr;* link underneath the article text. You'll need to set up an archives page and tell WordPress where it lives by filling in the `Settings > mm theme options > Archive page` box. Just add the page slug&thinsp;&#8211;&thinsp;you don't need the `http://yoursitename.com/` bit of the address.

### Archive pages

Create a new page using the `Widget page` template. Go to the `Appearance > Widgets` menu and drag widgets into the *Widget page area* to create an archive. You could add a list of categories, a tag cloud or a simple list of posts. Or you could use a plugin such as *Simple yearly archives*.
